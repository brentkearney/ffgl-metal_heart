## Resolume/FFGL Plugins

A collection of FFGL plugins for use in Resolume Arena 7. Demos and downloads here:

This repo may look a bit disorganized. Interesting / "finalized" code will be in `source/plugins/[effect name]/*.cpp`. Code in the shader files (`.frag`, `.glsl`, `.vert`) are probably WIP and not guaranteed to work.
